\section{Overview}
\label{sec:orgd2f8ce6}
\subsection{Environment}
\label{sec:orgc38f51d}
\begin{itemize}
\item The game is a single-agent environment.
\item The game is a complicated optimization where the agent must decide incoming jobs to accept and which to taken jobs to work on.
\item The goal of the game earn the most possible money from completing jobs
\end{itemize}
\subsection{State space}
\label{sec:org69b3ddf}
\begin{itemize}
\item The state space is the current day, as well as data for each job offer and currently taken job.
\item Each job is represented by:
\begin{enumerate}
\item number of workers required
\item complication probability (this determines how long the job takes to complete)
\item soft deadline
\item hard deadline
\item payment
\item expected length
\item rate of pay (payment / (workers * expected length)
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Action space}
\label{sec:org92fa457}
The action space is 27 binary outputs:
\begin{itemize}
\item 7 binary outputs for which of the up to 7 incoming jobs to accept
\item 20 binary outputs for the up to 20 jobs that can be accepted at a time.
\item Note: you may want to use an action mask so superfluous actions are ignored when updating
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Rewards}
\label{sec:org63b4d76}
\begin{itemize}
\item You receive the payment of any jobs completed on time
\item Payment is reduced as the job passes the soft deadline
\item You lose 0.3*payment for any jobs not completed by the hard deadline
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Terminal States}
\label{sec:org6557c42}
\begin{itemize}
\item The episode ends after 100 days
\end{itemize}
\section{Instructions}
\label{sec:org775029e}
Full details of the rules can be found in the instructions folder
\section{Software}
\label{sec:org600a8b0}
Software you can play (to get ideas for reward shaping and such) can be found in the software folder
\section{Heuristic Pretraining}
\label{sec:orgbebe71c}
If you wish to do pretraining, let me know and I will add instructions on how to generate data from heuristics
