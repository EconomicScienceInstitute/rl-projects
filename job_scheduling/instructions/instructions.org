* The Big Idea
** Payment
  - In this experiment, you will take on the role of a contractor.
  - To make money, you will accept job offers and complete them for clients.
  - You will be paid for completing jobs.
** Your Task
  - The experiment will consist of 100 days.
  - Each job needs multiple days of work to complete.
  - However, jobs have deadlines and you only have a limited number of workers, so your task is to decide:
    1) Which job offers to accept.
    2) Which of your jobs to work on each day.
* Job Offers
** Overview
  - Each day, you might receive some job offers.
  - Some jobs will be more difficult and require more workers or time to complete.
  - Others will have stricter deadlines or be more lucrative.
  - You will have to weigh whether you should accept the job offer based on how busy you are and the attractiveness of the offer.
  - Let's look more at these Job Offers.

* Completing Jobs
** Overview
  - When you work on a job, you will make some progress on it.
  - The amount of progress is random, but you will always complete at least 10% of the job each day you work on it.
  - Some jobs will tend to progress faster than others.
** Rules
  - The Length of the job estimates how long it will take on average.
  - There is more than a 90% chance the job will complete within the Range values.
  - However, there is always a chance (no matter how small) that a job will complete in just 1 day.
  - Conversely, any job can also require the full 10 days to complete (10% progress each day).
** Example

* Payment Penalties
** Overview
  - If you finish the job on time (before the Soft Deadline), you receive full payment.
  - If you finish the job late (after the Soft Deadline), you receive partial payment.
  - If you do not finish the job by the Hard Deadline, you receive no pay and must further pay a penalty.
** Details
  - For each day after the Soft Deadline, the payment decreases by 15%.
  - Once the Hard Deadline passes, you fail the job and it will cost you 20% of the original payment.
  - Let's see an example.
** Example
  - Suppose a job pays $1.00 if completed on time.
  - If you complete it 1 day after the Soft Deadline, you receive $1.00 - $0.15 = $0.85.
  - If you complete it 2 days after the Soft Deadline, you receive $1.00 - $0.30 = $0.70.
  - If you do not complete it by the Hard Deadline, you receive $0 and lose $0.20, regardless of how close you were to finishing.
* Review
  - You must decide which job offers to accept.
  - You must decide which of your current jobs to work on.
  - You are paid for completed jobs, and penalized for ones you fail to complete.
  - Some jobs will be better than others, so you will have to decide whether an offered job is worth accepting.
